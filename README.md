# Heart Disease Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. This repository features a cleaned dataset and a Jupyter Notebook with exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.


## Contents
| File / Directory | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `Heart Disease Data.csv` | The raw dataset containing patient health metrics and target labels indicating heart disease presence. |
| `Heart_Disease_Prediction_final.ipynb` | A clean, step-by-step Jupyter Notebook covering: data loading, preprocessing, EDA, model training (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, etc.), evaluation, and visual insights.|
| `READ.md` | This documentation file.|


## Notebook Overview
Inside `Heart_Disease_Prediction_final.ipynb`, you'll find:

- Data Exploration & Cleaning
  - Load `.csv` dataset with pandas.
  - Inspect features and handle missing values or outliers.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Visualize feature distributions, correlations, and target balance.

- Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
  - Encode categorical data, scale numeric features, and finalize features for modeling.

- Model Training & Evaluation
  - Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
  - Evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

- Results & Insights
  - Analyze feature importance and model strengths/weaknesses.
  - Provide visual plots (like ROC curves or feature importance bar charts).


## Usage Example
1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute sections in sequence:
   - Data Loading
   - EDA & Visualizations
   - Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
   - Model Training & Evaluation

3. Experiment by adjusting algorithms (e.g., try SVMs or XGBoost), tweaking hyperparameters, or adding more visual analyses.


## Future Enhancements
- Model tuning with cross-validation and grid/random search.
- Deploying API endpoints for real-time heart disease prediction.
- Creating interactive dashboards using tools like Streamlit or Dash.
- Applying explainability tools such as SHAP or LIME for feature-level transparency.
